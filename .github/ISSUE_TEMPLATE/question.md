**Question**

<!---
Describe what you are trying to achieve, and what you are having trouble with.

In order to save time for those who might consider helping you, provide just the needed details, and be as clear as possible. Too much detail is as bad as too few.

One-question per issue, please. If you have multiple questions, please post multiple issues.

Include what you have tried so far. Best of all, post your current chart online.

For vanilla JavaScript examples use:
CodePen (https://codepen.io/)
jsFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/)

For TypeScript/Angular/React use:
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/)
StackBlitz (https://stackblitz.com/).
