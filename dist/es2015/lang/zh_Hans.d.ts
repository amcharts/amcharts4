/**
 * amCharts 4 locale
 *
 * Locale: zh_Hans
 * Language: Simplified Chinese
 * Author: Bjorn Svensson
 *
 * Follow instructions in [on this page](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/tutorials/creating-translations/) to make corrections or add new translations.
 *
 * ---
 * Edit but leave the header section above this line. You can remove any
 * subsequent comment sections.
 * ---
 *
 * Use this file as a template to create translations. Leave the key part in
 * English intact. Fill the value with a translation.
 *
 * Empty string means no translation, so default "International English"
 * will be used.
 *
 * If you need the translation to literally be an empty string, use `null`
 * instead.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * When translating make good effort to keep the translation length
 * at least the same chartcount as the English, especially for short prompts.
 *
 * Having significantly longer prompts may distort the actual charts.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Some prompts - like months or weekdays - come in two versions: full and
 * shortened.
 *
 * If there's no official shortened version of these in your language, and it
 * would not be possible to invent such short versions that don't seem weird
 * to native speakers of that language, fill those with the same as full
 * version.
 *
 * PLACEHOLDERS:
 * Some prompts have placeholders like "%1". Those will be replaced by actual
 * values during translation and should be retained in the translated prompts.
 *
 * Placeholder positions may be changed to better suit structure of the
 * sentence.
 *
 * For example "From %1 to %2", when actually used will replace "%1" with an
 * actual value representing range start, and "%2" will be replaced by end
 * value.
 *
 * E.g. in a Scrollbar for Value axis "From %1 to %2" will become
 * "From 100 to 200". You may translate "From" and "to", as well as re-arrange
 * the order of the prompt itself, but make sure the "%1" and "%2" remain, in
 * places where they will make sense.
 *
 * Save the file as language_LOCALE, i.e. `en_GB.ts`, `fr_FR.ts`, etc.
