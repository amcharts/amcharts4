## [4.0.14] - 2019-01-02

### Added
- New setting `zoomStep` added to `MapChart`. Allows controlling zoom in/out speed.

### Fixed
- `Series.hidden` did not work as expected.
- World map did not work in Ember.
- Eliminated multiple warnings in recent version of Chrome regarding wheel events being active.
- Fixed mousewheel zoom in IEs.
- Draggable/resizable items were not working properly on some Android browsers.
- Setting `height` to a relative value for a horizontal `ColumnSeries` column template was not working propertly.


## [4.0.13] - 2018-12-26

### Fixed
- Charts were broken in IE9.


## [4.0.12] - 2018-12-24

### Fixed
- Cursor/mouse operations were somewhat broken in IE11 and lower.


## [4.0.11] - 2018-12-24

### Added
- `"disabled"` and `"enabled"` events added to `Sprite`.
- `cursorTooltipEnabled` added to `XYSeries`  If set to `false` cursor will not trigger bullet/item tooltips on series.

### Changed
- IMPORTANT (CODE-BREAKING CHANGES) For performance reasons we no longer create axis elements if they are disabled. For the same reasons we disabled by `axis.ticks` and `axis.axisFills` by default. Previously to enable them you had to set their `strokeOpacity` and/or `fillOpacity` to non-zero. This no longer will work. You will need to set `disabled` to `false` instead.
- `axisRanges` now take their default values from `dateAxis.axisRanges.template` items (`axisFill`, `grid`, `tick`, `label`). Previously they were using the defaults from `dateAxis.renderer.label` etc. This was not comfortable and counter-intuitive.

### Fixed
- `XYChartScrollbar`'s value axis was calculating `min`/`max` with a very big step.
- Ember plugin was throwing console errors.
- Fixed occasional zoom-in issue on Mobile Safari.
- `MapChart` mouse wheel zoom direction was inverted on some browsers.
- Cursor was not snapping correctly to `DateAxis` items.
- Multiple floating columns on the same category were disappearing when scrolling the chart.
- Date range fills were off when zooming on Gantt Chart.
- Overlapping tooltips problem solved.
- When `snapToSeries` was set for a tooltip, it was flickering a lot on slower browsers.
- `alignLabels = false` on a `PieSeries3D` was causing labels to be positioned incorrectly.
- `PieSeries.dataFields.radiusValue` was not accounting for `chart.innerRadius`.
- Dynamically updating `alignLabels` for `PieSeries` did not work correctly.
- Legend: `itemValueText` only worked if `valueText` was set.
- `ValueAxis` setting `maxZoomFactor = 1` was not working as expected.
- Changing values for all data items sometimes was resulting in `ValueAxis` scale going into negative.
- Some more tooltip and cursor related issues fixed.
- Axis Fill did not properly fill the whole span when axis was scaled.


## [4.0.10] - 2018-12-20

### Fixed
- In some situations, when `geodataSource` had events set, it was producing error.
- `DateAxis` was not rounding intervals properly, could display grid at `15:01`, `15:31` etc.
- Cloning an object was cloning sometimes was causing event handlers to be duplicated.
- A leftover console debug line was removed.


## [4.0.9] - 2018-12-19

### Added
- `snapToSeries` added to `XYCursor`. Allows setting series to which cursor lines should be snapped. Works if one of the axis of the series is `DateAxis` or `CategoryAxis`. Won't work if both axes are `ValueAxis`.
- New example: Pie charts in Columns using JSON config.
- Export: `emptyAs` added to both CSV and Excel export options. If set, missing values will be replaced with this value (default is empty string).
- New event `"beforedisposed"` added to `Sprite`. Kicks in right before the element starts to dismantle itself.
- Italian translation.

### Changed
- Export: if no `dataFields` specify it will now look for fields in all of the data, not just the first line.
- When creating a new state on an object, it will not automatically propagate itself on object's clones if `applyOnClones = true`.
- Setting `Container`'s `setStateOnChildren` will now propage to the new value to its existing clones if `applyOnClones = true`.
- In case `deepInvalidate()` is called on `Container`, it forces labels to redraw.
- `filters` on `SpriteState` is now `List` (was `ListTemplate`). It's better for performance which does not require creating Filter template object.

### Fixed
- Clicking a hoverable/clickable object was resultin in "over" and "out" events generated next to "hit".
- JSON: properties to existing `List` items were not being applied properly.
- Using geodata in Ember app was causing errors (Issue 672).
- Export to CSV/Excel was following first line of data values. It now respects `dataFields` setting, and will replace missing values with `emptyAs` (new options setting).
- Wheel-scrolling in MacOS Safari was very slow.
- HTML-based tooltips were too small to fit the actual contents on MaCOS Safari.
- `DateFormatter` was not parsing `"i"` format as local timezone, rather than UTC.
- Sometimes bullets with `Rectangle` element in them were not positioned properly.
- If category was named `"undefined"`, it was messing up label positions on `CategoryAxis`.
- State's property value was not being applied if current value of the property was `undefined`.
- Performance of `PieChart` and `RadarChart` improved dramatically under IEs.
- In some cases `"ready"` event was not being fired.
- `FunnelSeries` with 0 (zero) value slices was not rendered correctly.


## [4.0.8] - 2018-12-11

### Added
- `currentStep` added to `ColorSet`. Allows setting current position of the color iterator.
- Adapters added for `Sprite` properties: `inertiaOptions`, `hitOptions`, `hoverOptions`, `swipeOptions`, `keyboardOptions`, `cursorOptions`.

### Changed
- `nonScaling` of `AxisLabel` is no longer set to `true` by default, to improve performance.

### Fixed
- `ValueAxis` was not updating its scale if series was hidden and animated theme was not enabled.
- Zooming an `XYChart` with all values equal was broken.
- Series in an `XYChartScrollbar` sometimes was not visible initially.
- `ColumnSeries` was drawing 1px line for `null` value data items.
- `DateAxis`' `snapTooltip = true` was working incorrectly with `skipEmptyPeriods = true`.
- Logarithmic `ValueAxis` with axis breaks was resulting in stack overflows.
- JSON: Chaining multiple adapters in an array (e.g. `adapter: [{...}, {...}]`), was not working.
- JSON: Adding elements to `children` via array syntax was not working properly.
- JSON: `Container` elements can now be created via JSON config.
- Setting `dataFields` in `Export` was only affecting column names. Values for all data fields were still being included in export.


## [4.0.7] - 2018-12-07

### Added
- `snapTooltip` with default value `true` added to `DateAxis`. Cursor will snap to the nearest date at which series has values.

### Changed
- Default value of `showOnInit` set to `false` for `TreeMapSeries`.

### Fixed
- Solved tooltip overlapping bug.
- In `TreeMap`, when series is toggled off, remaining series will be resized to take up freed space.


## [4.0.6] - 2018-12-06

### Added
- `snapTooltip` added to `XYSeries`, with default value `false`. If set to `true`, the series will show nearest available tooltip when cursor is over plot area.
- Slovenian translation.

### Fixed
- Automatic `DateAxis` interval detection improved.


## [4.0.5] - 2018-12-06

### Changed
- `DateFormatter` will now automatically format "negative" year values to "BC" (era) format. So not `"-1000"`, but `"1000BC"`. These are translatable via language.
- `DropShadowFilter` of the tooltip removed. Instead it is now applied on background of tooltip. This helps to avoid text distortion.

### Fixed
- Heat rules were not working if all the values were the same. Now middle value between min and max is applied in this case.
- Updated algorithm to deal with date axes breaks. It's faster now and does not cause stackoverflow if the gaps are very big.
- Series on `HeatMap` charts were ignoring scrollbars.
- `DateAxis` was not properly placing labels if `location > 0` and grid interval was bigger than one time unit.
- `DateAxis` with very big date difference (thousands of years) displayed too many grid/labels/ticks.
- Masking of a sprite with a container updated. It now pays proper attention to container's position.
- Automatic `DateAxis` interval detection improved. Previously it detected intervals like minutes, hours, days, years. Now it will detect intervals like 15 min, 30 min, 5 days etc. This can still be set manually using axis' `baseInterval` property.


## [4.0.4] - 2018-12-03

### Added
- `zoomLevel` and `zoomGeoPoint` properties added to `MapSeriesDataItem` and `IMapSeriesDataFields`. If set, these settings instead of automatically-calculated will be used when `zoomToMapObject()` method is invoked.

### Changed
- `verticalCenter` and `horizontalCenter` is no longer applied to rotated axis labels. If you are setting `rotation` on axis labels, make sure to adjust these settings as well as per your requirement.

### Fixed
- Setting `axis.renderer.inside` was ignored if set after chart was already initialized.
- Changing `align` of the a sprite was ignored if set after it was already initialized.
- Top level `TreeMap` segment tooltip was positioned incorrectly after drilling down and back up.
- `min`/`max` of `ValueAxis` was not being updated after `invalidateRawData()` call, and series were stacked.
- Tooltip sometimes was pointing outside chart container.
- `ChordLink` bullets were not properly positioned on init.
- `DateAxis` was not working well if `baseInterval.count > 1`.


## [4.0.3] - 2018-11-30

### Added
- Ability to set default locale via `am4core.options.defaultLocale`. When set, all new charts will automatically assume that locale, freeing you from setting locale for each chart individually.
- `reverseOrder` added to `Container`. Allows reversing order of its `children`.

### Changed
- Moved `Legend` of a `MapChart` from `chartAndLegendContainer` to `chartContainer`. In order to position legend on map chart, use `legend.align` / `legend.valign` properties.
- Default value of `showOnInit` on any `Series` is now `false`. Except if you are using "animated" theme, which sets it to `true` by default.

### Fixed
- JSON: Using `type: "Sprite"` in JSON config was not creating elements properly.
- Initial chart rendering optimized Charts should build faster.
- Some more performance optimizations.
- Setting `hiddenInLegend` on `Series` after chart was already built had no effect.


## [4.0.2] - 2018-11-28

### Added
- New method `setInterval()` on all base objects added. Works exactly like JS's `setInterval` but is automatically killed when target object is disposed.
- Added array utilities to `am4core`.

### Changed
- Removed unused `"label"` adapter from `Axis`.

### Fixed
- [Issue 588.](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts4/issues/588)
- Fixed mouse wheel and zoom control zooming of a map which does not occupies all the div size.
- Fixed map scaling issues of a map which does not occupies all the div size.
- Sometimes axis labels were not formatted using number or other formatters.
- Adapters of data items were not being copied to clones.
- `text` property of `AxisDataItem` was not being copied to clones.


## [4.0.1] - 2018-11-24

### Fixed
- Issues with stacked series and `min`/`max` of `ValueAxis` fixed.
- Chart cursor now dispatches `"panning"` event only if moved by at least 3 pixels. This solves problem with panning on click.
- If `extraMin`/`extraMax` were set on `ValueAxis`, some unnecessary zoom used to happen.


## [4.0.0] - 2018-11-22

### Changed
- Droping BETA tag!
- `DropShadowFilter` will now always use balck by default instead of `"alternativeBackground"` from the theme.

### Fixed
- Setting `hiddenInLegend = true` on Series was causing the chart to hang.


## [4.0.0-beta.87] - 2018-11-22

### Added
- Full source code for amCharts 4 is now included under `/src/`.

### Changed
- Full language files are now under `/src/lang/`. If you need to make a translation, do a PR on those files/dir.


## [4.0.0-beta.86] - 2018-11-20

### Fixed
- In some situations waiting for `"ready"` event was producing unnecessary frame requests.


## [4.0.0-beta.85] - 2018-11-20

### Added
- `"ready"` event added to `Sprite`. Sprite fires it right after `"init"` event. `Container` fires it when all of its children are ready.
- `system.isPaused` property added. Setting it to `true` will effectively pause any chart activity, making them completely static.
- `ErrorBullet` class added. Allows drawing error charts. (Check `error-chart` and `xy-error-chart` examples for code samples)
- JSON: String-based `cursorOverStyle` and `cursorDownStyle` are not supported.

### Fixed
- JSON: Setting `ColorSet` properties `baseColor` or `list`  was not working properly.
- Accessibility: Legend item was not properly referring to a Series via `labelled-by`.
- `Label.wrap` was breaking lines mid-word even if there where words that would fit into alotted space.
- Memory leak fixed.
- Sometimes `Animation` was not firing `"animationended"` event (when elastic easing was used).


## [4.0.0-beta.84] - 2018-11-18

### Added
- `exportable` (default `true`) property added to `Sprite`. If set to `true` this element will not appear in the exported image of the chart.

### Changed
- `exportable` is now set to `false` by default on `Scrollbar` grips, zoom out button.

### Fixed
- JSON: `dateFormats` was being ignored.


## [4.0.0-beta.83] - 2018-11-15

### Added
- [`hideOverflow`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/svgcontainer/#hideOverflow_property) added to `SVGContainer` class. If set to `true` it will apply `overflow: hidden` to chart container so that all chart elements are contained within. Default is `false`, except on `MapChart`, which has it at `true`.

### Fixed
- Some adjustments and fixes to animations associated with `hide()`/`show()` functions.
- If a legend was initially disabled, it was not appearing when enabled later.
- `chart.addData()` was not adding data to `XYChart` scrollbar series.


## [4.0.0-beta.82] - 2018-11-14

### Added
- JSON: `forceCreate` property added. If found in an item of an array, it will force creation of the new object, even if object with same index already exists in target `List`.
- French locale.

### Changed
- Adjusted animation durations in "animated" theme.

### Fixed
- JSON: String-based percent and color values were not being parsed correctly in some cases.
- JSON: `HeatLegend` was erroring if its `series` property was referencing to Series by id.
- Disposing an item with a custom `id` set was not clearing it from id map properly resulting in errors if item with the same id was being added later.
- `SankeyDiagram` was not taking chart's padding into account when sizing itself.
- Axis ticks were not being positioned properly after data update.
- Map using `deltaLongitude` was being positioned incorrectly.
- 3D columns z-indexing was sometimes incorrect.
- `PieChart` label placement with custom `startAngle`/`endAngle` was sometimes off.
- Label bullets on columns were not being restored from truncated state when width of the columns was increasing.
- Series `show()`/`hide()` were using `interpolationDuration` setting instead of `defaultState`/`hiddenState` transition duration when showing/hiding.


## [4.0.0-beta.81] - 2018-11-13

### Fixed
- `chart.hiddenState.properties.opacity` is no longer set to `1` by default. Removed this in order it to be `0` so that charts using animated theme would always fade-in.
- Better initial rendering of `ValueAxis` (removed unneeded animations).
- Sometimes map was not positioning itself at `homeGeoPoint`.
- Map with Eckert6 projection in some cases was not displayed properly.


## [4.0.0-beta.80] - 2018-11-13

### Fixed
- Legend in external container was resulting in infinite loop.
- Rendering an arrow on a `MapLine` with same source and destination point was resulting in error.

## [4.0.0-beta.79] - 2018-11-12

### Fixed
- `goHome()` on `MapChart` was not working properly.
- `projection` change on `MapChart` was not working properly.


## [4.0.0-beta.78] - 2018-11-11

### Changed
- `DataParser` property `type` was renamed to `contentType` in order not to conincide with JSON-based config built-in keyword `type`.

### Fixed
- Some rendering issues fixed.


## [4.0.0-beta.77] - 2018-11-10

### Fixed
- Removed console debug (yes, again).


## [4.0.0-beta.76] - 2018-11-10

### Fixed
- Removed console debug.


## [4.0.0-beta.75] - 2018-11-10

### Added
- You can now use `"{percent}"` placeholder in `tooltipText` of `HeatMapSeries` items.

### Fixed
- Draggable/trackable areas of the chart were intercepting all mouse buttons, including right and back/forward.
- Fixed `MapChart` issue with dragging map by touch on hybrid devices.


## [4.0.0-beta.74] - 2018-11-08

### Fixed
- `ColumnSeries3D` were broken since last release.


## [4.0.0-beta.73] - 2018-11-07

### Changed
- `axisFills.template.interactionsEnabled` is now set to `false` by default. If you need to attach events on an axis fill, you will need to set it to `true`.

### Added
- `autoDispose` property added to `Series` and `Axis` classes with default value `true`. This means that series/axis will be automatically disposed when removed from chart's `series`, `xAxes`, or `yAxes` lists.
- It is now possible to have 3D stacked columns (by setting `clustered = false` on series).

### Fixed
- If chart container was moved in DOM tree, it stopped sensing resize and was not updating its size anymore.
- Sometimes `ValueAxis` could show zero label with a minus sign.
- Arrows on `MapLine` were not drawn.
- It was not possible to change the text color of the tooltip on `TreeMap` diagram.
- `axis.tooltipPosition = "pointer"` was not working as it should - always follow the mouse/pointer.
- If series had `data` set directly, it was still using chart's global `data`, resulting in combined datasets and potentially visual anomalies.
- Setting `cellStartLocation` did not have any effect on an already inited chart.
- Line series could be cut off in the beginning (when zoomed-in closely).
- Vertical axis ticks were not being positioned properly if axis had a title.
- 3D columns were not using chart's `depth`/`angle`.


## [4.0.0-beta.72] - 2018-11-03

### Changed
- For any `XYSeries` if the `itemReaderText` is not set explicitly, it will automatically try to fill with values from `dataFields`, so that each series element, like a Column has at least rudimentary screen-reader text.

### Fixed
- Added in TypeScript 3.x support.
- `ColumnSeries` with two category axes anomaly fixed.


## [4.0.0-beta.71] - 2018-11-01

### Fixed
- Calling `dispose()` on a `TreeMap` was causing an error.
- Legend items were being duplicated every time its disabled property was reset back to `false`.


## [4.0.0-beta.70] - 2018-10-31

### Fixed
- Keyboard dragging of elements such as scrollbar grips was not working.
- "hoverable" elements were not staying "hovered" after tap in Mobile Safari.
- `addData()` with more than one data item added was not working well.
- Zoomout button was visible on initial animation.
- Dynamically changing `Legend.position` was not updating its layout properly.
- Vertical axis tick position with rotated labels was incorrect.


## [4.0.0-beta.69] - 2018-10-30

### Fixed
- Some charts were not properly displayed if initialized in a hidden (`display: none`) container, then revealed (`display: block`).
- Last slice of the `PyramidSeries` was not visible for certain widths.
- Adding `Legend` to a chart that had series with bullets using heatrules was causing an error.
- Label rotation was being ignored on `SlicedChart`.
- Labels of `PyramidSeries` were not centered (when `alignLabels = false`).
- Animation of labels for horizontal `PictorialSeries` was very jumpy.
- `position` and `rotation` of labels in `PyramidSeries` was not working properly.
- An error was occurring if chart's with a category axis data was updated and it contained less data points than before.


## [4.0.0-beta.68] - 2018-10-30

### Changed
- `tooltip.defaultState.transitionDuration` and `tooltip.hiddenState.transitionDuration` default values of animated theme set to `400`.

### Fixed
- Chart was not being drawn properly when instantiated in a hiden container.


## [4.0.0-beta.67] - 2018-10-29

### Fixed
- Chart `Cursor` was preventing hovers on series' elements like columns or bullets.
- Mouse cursor's down styles (like on scrollbar) were not being reset back properly in some cases.


## [4.0.0-beta.66] - 2018-10-28

### Fixed
- Axis glitches in `XYChart3D`.
- `XYCursor` movement issues.


## [4.0.0-beta.65] - 2018-10-28

### Changed
- `tooltip.hiddenState.transtionDuration` and `tooltip.defaultState.transitionDuration` are now set to 1 (on non-animated theme) to avoid some tooltip flickering.
- Individual legend items (label, value label, and marker) now have their  `interactionsEnabled = false` set by default to avoid double events. If you need to add events to these particular elements (as opposed to the whole legend item), you will need to set `interactionsEnabled = true` on that element.

### Fixed
- Calling `show()` on a `MapSeries` object was resulting in an error.
- 3D columns were not visible if their value was zero.
- Bullets are now hidden if `minBulletDistance` is set.


## [4.0.0-beta.64] - 2018-10-27

### Added
- `shouldClone` flag added to `EventDispatcher`'s `on` and `once` methods. Can be used to restrict cloning of events when object itself is cloned.
- [`showOnInit`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/sprite/#showOnInit_property) property added to `Sprite`. If this is set to `true`, the `Sprite`, when inited will be instantly hidden ("hidden" state applied) and then shown (animate properties form "hidden" state to "default" state). Animation will take `defaultState.transitionDuration`. `Series`, `Chart` classes has this set to `true`, so that they would perform initial animations. If you want a sprite (chart, series) not to be shown initially, you can set Sprite's [`hidden`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/sprite/#hidden_property) to `true`. (`setting sprite.visible = true` won't work as expected anymore).

### Changed
- If chart rendering takes too long, it now is split into chunks, which makes the browser/page remain responsive even if you have a lot of charts to build.
- Changed how pre-hiding Series works. If you want series to be initially hidden, use `series.hidden = true` instead of `series.visible = false`.
- Removed `"hold"` and `"rotate"` interaction events and releated options and functionality, since they weren't used anywhere.
- Removed `"delayFirstHit"` option from `Sprite.hitOptions`.
- `chart.defaultState.transitionDuration` is set to `1`. This allows the chart to appear one frame after init and helps to avoid various flickers that happen while chart is building. Animated theme has this value set to `2000`.

### Fixed
- Performance enhancements.
- Non-draggable/trackable but otherwise interactive elements of the chart no longer prevent scrolling and other gestures on touch screens.
- `PieSeries` labels sometimes were positioned incorrectly (using non-default start/end angles).
- Slices (also columns of `RadarChart`) were not drawn if `radius <= 0` (even if `innerRadius > 0`). This resulted in radar columns not rendered in some cases.
- `MapChart` was not resizing properly when div size changed.
- `PictorialStackedSeries`, while `containerdiv` was resized did flicker a lot.
- If a Tooltip is visible while its Sprite changes size/position, it updates its position as well.
- Setting `chart.data = []` was not clearing data properly.


## [4.0.0-beta.63] - 2018-10-20

### Fixed
- In some cases a `PieChart` could overlap its legend.
- `PieChart` flicker after `invalidateData` fixed.
- An error was occurring when data was updated on chart with series with bullet while hovering it with cursor.


## [4.0.0-beta.62] - 2018-10-19

### Fixed
- Tooltip issue fixed.

## [4.0.0-beta.61] - 2018-10-19

### Changed
- If element has `url` set, when clicked, it will now parse for data placeholders in curcly brackets, e.g. `"{category}"` allowing have dynamic data-driven URLs. Note, the elements are not url-encoded so you need to specify encoding manually, e.g.: `series.columns.template.url = "https://www.google.com/search?q={category.urlEncode()}";`.

### Fixed
- `Label.fullWords = false` was not working properly.
- `AxisLabelCircular` was positioning labels incorrectly, if label.radius was negative (since 59).
- `"grid"` layout in `Container` was incorrectly layouting elements if their `width` was set in percent.
- [IE] Multi-line truncated labels were not working properly on IE.
- [IE] was incorrectly zIndexing elemens (since version 56).
- [IE] tooltip initial flicker solved.
- [IE] was incorrectly sorting multiple series tooltips (if `Cursor` was used).


## [4.0.0-beta.60] - 2018-10-18

### Changed
- `"hidden"` data field added to series' `dataFields`. Removed `"visible"` data field from `PercentSeries`. You should use `"hidden"` data field to set which slices/columns/etc. are hidden initally.
- `AxisLabelCircular`'s `radius` can now be set in `Percent`. `PieChart`'s label radius default value was set to `5%`.

### Fixed
- Multi-line labels were not being aligned properly in IEs.
- In some cases, `fillModifier` was not applied if set after `fill`.
- In some cases, a chart with `seriesContainer` disabled, or when `seriesContainer`'s height/width was 0, could produce a JS error.
- Some performance tuneups, especially for charts with axes and more data.


## [4.0.0-beta.59] - 2018-10-17

### Added
- [`widthRatio`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/image/#widthRatio_property) and [`heightRatio`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/image/#heightRatio_property) properties on `Image`.

### Fixed
- Some adapters for Axis elements were being applied twice.


## [4.0.0-beta.58] - 2018-10-17

### Added
- `ExportMenu`'s "custom" items can now have `"callback"` which is a function to call when clicked on such custom item.

### Changed
- Slice labels on a `PieChart` now move with the slice (if `alignLables = false`).

### Fixed
- `requestAnimationFrame` now is called only when needed. This reduces idle CPU usage.
- Fixed `m4core.color()` result caching issue.
- Charts were broken in IEs since beta.57.
- `Tooltip` on `LineSeries` was not updating color if segment changed color.
- `MapChart` without any series was displaying an error in console.
- Axis tooltip was trimmed when `renderer.inside = true`.
- `StepLineSeries` `startLocation`/`endLocation` bug fixed.
- `"hover"` state was not being applied to series' bullet if it did not hav `tooltipText` set.
- `bulletLocation` for horizontal `ColumnSeries` fixed.
- Value labels of `Legend` were not in correct positions if `Legend` was positioned at the top or bottom (too close to legend label).


## [4.0.0-beta.57] - 2018-10-15

### Changed
- All charts (that inherit from `Chart`) now will apply "hidden" state right after they are validated, then immediately "default" state. This allows creating initial animations such as fade-in (if using animated theme). All you need to do is set: `chart.hiddenState.properties.opacity = 0;`.

### Fixed
- Mouse wheel zoom was broken since beta.56 on `MapChart`.
- Pushing `Sprite` to `Container.children` directly (instead of setting parent) used to produce a JS error.


## [4.0.0-beta.56] - 2018-10-12

### Added
- New `Sprite` adapter: `"populateString"`. Applied to strings after `Sprite` replaces data binders with real values, but before any formatting by `Label` kicks in.
- New `Label` property: [`ignoreFormatting`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/label/#ignoreFormatting_property). If set to `true` will treat formatting blocks in square brackes (e.g. `"[red bold]"`) as regular text and will display them as such.

### Changed
- Default big, small, and byte suffixes in `NumberFormatter` are now translatable via locale files.
- The suffix for thousands "kilo", was changed to lowercase "k", as per [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Prefixes).
- On `XYChart`, default for [`mouseWheelBehavior`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/xychart/#mouseWheelBehavior_property) changed to `"none"` (was `"zoomX"`).

### Fixed
- Improved performance! All charts types are now noticably, some drastically are faster. Some memory leakages fixed as well.
- Now `MapPolygonSeries` will not inherit chart's global `geodata` if it has own `geodataSource` set.
- `DateFormatter` was not parsing all AM/PM string dates correctly.
- `DateFormatter` was not parsing `MMM` (short month names like "Jan", "Feb") propertly.
- In-line date formatter was not working correctly in some cases, e.g. `"{dateX.formatDate()}"`.
- Setting `chart.mouseWheelBehavior = "none"` did not release wheel scrolling of the web page when hovering over chart.
- `DataSource`'s' `"done"` event was being called if parsing of loaded data failed. Not anymore. `"done"` is called only on successful load. To catch any load (including one that ended in http or parse error) use `"ended"`.
- `DataSource`'s' `reloadFrequency` was broken if error occurred during one of the loads. This has been fixed. Even if error occurrs, loader will try to reload data in the next reload slot.
- JSON: `heatRules` did not work properly with their target set to a list template, e.g. `mapPolygons.template`.
- Auto-calculated `DateAxis.baseInterval` was not being carried over to the `XYChartScrollbar`.
- `DurationAxis` scale sometimes was dropping to negative values, even there were no negative values in data.
- `PieChart` and `Legend` were not working properly with `chart.zoom()` or `legend.zoom()` methods.


## [4.0.0-beta.55] - 2018-09-26

### Added
- New series type suitable for `SlicedChart`: `PictorialStackedSeries`. (check `pictorial-stacked-chart` and `pictorial-stacked-chart-horizontal` demos)
- New themes: "dataviz", "moorisekingdom", "frozen", "spiritedaway".
- New Chart property: `logo`. If you are using amCharts with a free license, it holds reference to amCharts logo. Use it to position logo with `align` and `valign` properties.
- New `FunnelTick` properties: `locationX` and `locationY`. Allow specifying a relative location within target element where tick is pointing to.

### Changed
- `FunnelChart` was renamed to `SlicedChart`. The previous name did not correctly represent capabilities of the chart type that can display not only funnel series, but also pyramids and stacked pictorial series. `FunnelSeries` remains as it was before.

### Fixed
- Mouse wheel zoom was extremely slow in FireFox.
- Sometimes colors duplicate colors were generated by `ColorSet`.
- HTML-based labels were not accounting for "pixel ratio" on Retina displays, making tooltips larger then they are supposed to be.


## [4.0.0-beta.54] - 2018-09-22

### Fixed
- Chart Cursor was working only for the first chart on the same page.
- `CSVParser` was not parsing `dateFields` and `numberFields` correctly.
- Issues with labels rendering in incorrect position fixed.
- `LinearGradientModifier` was not copying gradient properties to clones (since last version only).
- `FunnelSlice` sometimes rendered slice edges with no anti-aliasing.
- When calculating area of the Pyramid slices height of `sliceConnector` was not being taken into account.
- Reset `label.renderingFrequency` back to `1` to solve some unwanted label flickering.
- `MapImage` items were not showing if added via `series.data` (since last version only).


## [4.0.0-beta.53] - 2018-09-21

### Added
- New property `durationFormat` on `DurationFormatter`. If set, it will force this format to be used, instead of one determined by `baseUnit`.


## [4.0.0-beta.52] - 2018-09-21

### Added
- `CurvedColumnSeries` added. Allows having columns as curves or as triangles. Check `curved-column-chart` and `triangle-column-chart` in examples folder.
- `RadialGradientModifier` class added. Allows building more donut-like pie charts. Check `semi-circle-donut-chart` in examples.
- New chart type: `FunnelChart`, which can show regular FunnelSeries and PyramidSeries.
- New axis type: `DurationAxis`. Values on it are treated and formatted like time durations.
- `extraMin` and `extraMax` properties added to `ValueAxis`. Can be used to relatively adjust calculated minimum and maximum scale values.
- Two new read-only properties added to `Container`: `contentWidth` and `contentHeight`. Will hold width/height in pixels of the actual dimensions of elements in Container.

### Changed
- `DurationFormatter` now uses `TimeUnit` for its `baseUnit`, rather than arbitrary codes.
- `durationFormat` property was removed from `DurationFormatter`. Use [`getFormat()`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/durationformatter/#getFormat_method) method to get correct format instead, then pass in to `format()`.
- Series will not show a tooltip (if one axis is `CategoryAxis`) if there is no value for this category (used to show tooltip if it had some extra text).

### Fixed
- Legend `valueLabel` values were not shown on chart initial render.
- 3D pie slices were not showing full stroke, only on the upper part of a slice.
- Sometimes `XYChart` did some additional animation even after all series finished animating, causing zoom-out flashing briefly.
- `XYChartScrollbar` was not showing series if data to the original series was added later (or changed).
- Chrome was not showing line series in `XYChartScrollbar` if all values were equal.
- Creating an empty line (without `multiGeoLine` set) was resulting in critical error.


## [4.0.0-beta.51] - 2018-09-13

### Changed
- Changed `Label.renderingFrequency` to `2`, for better performance.

### Fixed
- Performance tweaking.
- `DateAxis.baseInterval` was ignored in JSON-based configs.
- `"hoverActive"` state was not always being correctly applied.
- Better handling of cursor zoom and pan when outside chart area.
- Fixed occasional error when formatting dates or numbers.
- Line chart starts new segement only if properties (like `stroke`, `fill`, `strokeDashArray`, etc.) in data have changed. It used to start new segment if properties in data were defined resulting in reduced performance and disabled smoothed lines.
- Labels were not updating their position if their `fontSize` changed.
- `Sprite.nonScalingStroke = true` was ignored if set after `Sprite.strokeWidth`.
- `LineSeries` could leave some garbage lines while zooming.
- `ColumnSeries` could leave some garbage columns while zooming.
- `DateAxis` with one date only in chart data was not rendered properly.
- The chart was not zooming out after data validation.
- Added `ghostLabel` to `Axis` which is an invisible label and it helps to avoid unwanted changes of axis widht/height when the scale changes, e.g. on zoom.
- `zoomToMapObject`, if used with `MapPolygon` and custom `zoomLevel` was not working properly.
- `"hidden"` event of Series was called on initial chart initialization.


## [4.0.0-beta.50] - 2018-09-10

### Added
- `am4core.unuseAllThemes()` method added. Any chart created after this method call will not have any theme applied to it.
- New property `am4core.registry.baseSprites` will now hold all active (non-disposed) instances of top-level elements, such as charts.
- `startLocation`/`endLocation` properties added to `CategoryAxis` (previously available on `DateAxis` only). Allows to specify location the first and last cells of the axis should start on respectively.
- `innerRadius` of a Slice can now be set as `Percent` (e.g. `am4core.percent(50)`).
- You can now set custom radii (`radius` property) on Pie series (if you have more than one, you might want one to be larger and another smaller).

### Changed
- [`MapLine.imagesToConnect`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/mapline/#imagesToConnect_property) now accepts an array of string IDs that can reference images by their `id` property.
- Changed `tooltip` inheritance so that it checks for `virtualParent` rather than direct `parent`. E.g. series' bullets use series' tooltip and not chart tooltip as it was before.

### Fixed
- Map polygon stroke thickness could be rendered incorrectly when zooming quickly. (Issue #175)
- Calling `addData()` more than once before data was validated resulted only last data item to be added. (Issue #222)
- `DateAxis.baseInterval` was ignored if data was set directly on series.
- `MapLine` was not paying attention to the properties set on template.
- `HeatLegend` was not updating its label count after its size changed. This could have been resulting in very few labels if initial container (div) size was small.
- The map portion of `MapChart` was incorrectly positioned after container (div) resize.
- Object properties, like `"name"` in GeoJSON were overriding same properties in `MapSeries` data. Now, the values specified in data are used over ones in GeoJSON. (Issue #307)
- Axis ranges used to reset `axisRange.label.text`. (Issue #308)
- Fixed issues with disposing series and charts.
- Updated to [canvg 1.5.3](https://github.com/canvg/canvg/releases/tag/v1.5.3) to fix em/rem text issue for epoxrt fallbacks.


## [4.0.0-beta.49] - 2018-09-05

### Added
- JSON config: added `callback` property, which if it holds a reference to function will call it within the scope of the object being prepared.
- Adapters for `url` and `urlTarget` properties.
- Chart can now be panned or zoomed using mouse wheel. To set what it does use `mouseWheelBehavior` on `XYChart` (see next point)
- [`mouseWheelBehavior`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/xychart/#mouseWheelBehavior_property) added to `XYChart`. Options: `"zoomX"` (default), `"zoomY"`, `"zoomXY"`, `"panX"`, `"panY"`, `"panXY"`, `"none"`.
- [`mouseWheelBehavior`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/mapchart/#mouseWheelBehavior_property) added to `MapChart`. Options: `"zoom"` (default), `"none"`.

### Changed
- Second parameter to `Cursor`'s [`triggerMove()`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/cursor/#triggerMove_method) method was changed from boolean to enumeration of "stickiness" level: `"hard"`, `"soft"`, `"none"` (default).

### Fixed
- Error fixed when `Popup` object was being disposed.
- Over-panning of an `XYChart` did not disappear after mouse button was released outside chart.
- Multiple memory leaks fixed.
- `MapChart` was rounding lat/long coordinates too much which was resulting in pixelated maps for small-area maps.


## [4.0.0-beta.48] - 2018-08-31

### Added
- `useWebFonts` setting in `Export`. Allows disabling of download of web fonts when exporting.
- `useRetina` setting in `Export`. Images are now exported scaled up on retina displays by default. Set `useRetina = false` to disable.

### Changed
- Export fallback mechanism for older browsers changed from FabricJS to canvg, which is much lighter and has better text formatting support.
- On retina displays images will now export supersized in order not to lose quality. Set `useRetina = false` to disable.
- amCharts logo will now auto-hide on supersmall chart sizes.

### Fixed
- Cursor was zooming the chart even if drag motion was performed on an external element positioned over the chart.
- Cursor was not hidden when it was no longer hovering the chart area if chart had no padding.
- `urlTarget` was not carried over from `ListTemplate` template to new items.
- Cursor could cause chart to freeze up on a DateAxis with empty cells in the axis' beginning or end.
- Export will now correctly handle web fonts, such as Google Fonts. Please note that FontAwesome is not supported, since they forbit any kind of usage, except inclusion via CSS.


## [4.0.0-beta.47] - 2018-08-24

### Added
- New series type: `OHLCSeries`.
- `goHome()` method added to `MapChart`. Calling it will reset map to `homeZoomLevel` and `homeGeoPoint`.
- `homeGeoPoint` added to `MapChart`. Allows setting initial `geoPoint` at which map will be centered.
- `homeZoomLevel` added to `MapChart`. Allows setting initial `zoomLevel`.
- `maxPanOut` property added to `MapChart`, with default value `0.7`. It prevents map to be dragged out of the chart area.
- `noRisers` property added to `StepLineSeries`. It allows step line chart without vertical (or horizontal, depending on orientation) lines.
- Step line without risers now allows making Waterfall chart. Example added.
- `startLocation` and `endLocation` added to `StepLineSeries`, that allow controling locations at which step should start/end.
- `maxPrecision` added for `ValueAxis`. Use it to restrict Value axis to show value labels with less than desired precision (set 0 if you only want integers).
- Portugese (Portugal) translation added.

### Changed
- `Cursor` will now not move if there's some element obstructing the chart's plot area, e.g. a popup or some other element outside the chart.

### Fixed
- Series' and axes' tooltips will now correctly inherit formatters.
- Errors when hovering mouse cursor over open Modal.
- JSON: `children` property of `Container`-type objects was not being processed correctly.
- Popup/Modal now sets `aria-label` automatically if title is set.
- Removing bullet template from series or disposing it will remove/dispose all the bullets created from it.
- Tooltips were overlapping each other, fixed for the most part, but might still be some situations where they overlap.
- Changing data for `MapImageSeries` and `MapLineSeries` used to result runtime error.


## [4.0.0-beta.46] - 2018-08-19

### Fixed
- `TreeMap.homeText` was not working.
- `TreeMap` used to display upper level bullets/labels when drilled-down.
- `TreeMap` had issues with hiding items using legend (when not using animated state).
- Chart cursor was not visible if data was set directly on axis/series but not on chart.


## [4.0.0-beta.45] - 2018-08-17

### Added
- New hardcoded `Sprite` state name added `"hoverActive"` which (if defined) is applied on active elements on hover. This state is applied last in the chain.
- New property on `DataSource`: `keepCount`. If set to `true` incremental updates will remove data items from the beginning of the current dataset, when adding the newly-loaded ones.
- New property on `DataSource`: `incrementalParams`. It's an object whose key/value pairs will be added to URL as parameters when DataSource is making an incremental load request.
- `Popup` (and `Modal`) now have an event dispatcher (`events`) with two events: `"opened"` and `"closed"`. ([more info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/popups-and-modals/#Event_handlers))

### Changed
- Legend now respects `itemContainers.template.togglable = false`, which disables default functionality of toggling items when clicked in legend, allowing users to attach their own funcitonality to legend item clicks.
- Toggling of items in Legend can now be disabled by setting `chart.legend.itemContainers.template.togglable = false`.
- In `XYChart` with a `DateAxis`, cursor and data at irregular intervals will now display a Tooltip for nearest available series' data item.
- `zoomToCategories` method of `CategoryAxis` now zooms to the end of the "to" category.
- Default `urlTarget` of amCharts logo is now `"_blank"`.

### Fixed
- In `DataSource` the formatters `inputDateFormat` was ignored.
- Incremental data load via `DataSource` was not working.
- Tooltip used to flicker ar 0,0 position in some cases when hovering over elements.
- Fixed issue which caused chart to gradually shrink to invisibility under some conditions.
- Fixed rendering errors for charts that were initialized in hidden containers.
- `XYCursor` lines and axis tooltips were not shown if chart did not have any data (data was set directly on axis/series).


## [4.0.0-beta.44] - 2018-08-14

### Added
- `TreeMap` now supports legend. Legend will be displayed if a) `TreeMap` data is at least two levels deep (legend displays items from a second level); b) `chart.maxLevels` is set to `2` (without setting it no second-level series are created so legend does not have anything to build itself from). [More info](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/treemap/#Legend).
- Swedish translation.

### Changed
- `DateFormatter` will now automatically capitalize month/weekday name if it's the first (or only) word in resulting formatted date. This can be turned off by setting formatter's [`capitalize`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/dateformatter/#capitalize_property) to `false`.

### Fixed
- Removed `@deprecated` commented out methods/properties that were confusing tslint.
- Issue that caused the chart to shrink was fixed.


## [4.0.0-beta.43] - 2018-08-12

### Changed
- `$net.load()` options parameter now supports `responseType`. If set to `"blob"` will return response as `Blob` object in `result.blob`.

### Fixed
- Value axis min/max calculation algorithm adjusted. Fixed an issue with `strictMinMax = true` and issue with min/max when axis size was very small.
- Export now correctly uses external fonts included via `@import`, such as Google Fonts.
- Non-clickable columns in `ColumnSeries` will no longer gain focus on click/tap, unless its `hitOptions.noFocus` is set to `false`.
- Noon was incorrectly formatted as "AM", instead of "PM".
- `TextFormatter` was producing invalid `style` value on empty formatting blocks (`"[]"`).
- `parent` was not being set for a `Sprite` that was pushed directly to `Container.children`.
- If axis labels were disabled, ranges labels were not visible.
- Axis used to reset some of the user-set values when initing renderer, e.g. `dateAxis.renderer.grid.template.location = 0.5` was not working.
- `XYChart` with category axis + date axis was not working properly.
- Stacked chart with logarithmic axis was not working properly.
- JSON: local formatter instances were not being instantiated properly, so all children objects were reusing chart's main formatters.
- JSON: Patterns are now supported.


## [4.0.0-beta.42] - 2018-08-05

### Fixed
- Updated default Popup CSS to eliminate a rare scrollbar flashing issue.
- Fixed an error with PDF exporting.

## [4.0.0-beta.41] - 2018-08-03

### Added
- `MapSeries` now has `geodata` and `geodataSource`. This allows setting separate maps to each separate map series, which no longer rely on single chart-wide `geodata`. Also, setting `geodata` for `MapSeries` will automatically set `useGeodata = true`, so no need to set it manually.

### Changed
- Removed unused `boldUnitChange` from `DateAxis`.
- Labels on `DateAxis` will now pay attention to `label.location` if label represents full time period between grids. It no longer will force labels to be in the middle.
- `label.currentText` is now public.

### Fixed
- Fixed parsing of string dates in ISO format (`"i"`).
- Legend marker was not aligned with the text (when marker was smaller).
- Solved legend error which happens if you show/hide series after series was added/removed.
- Dynamically adding series was not automatically adjusting axis scales.
- Vertical `CategoryAxis` was not paying attention to `grid.location`.
- Map issues at `minZoomLevel < 1` fixed.


## [4.0.0-beta.40] - 2018-08-02

### Added
- German translation. (de_DE)

### Changed
- [`XYChart.getUpdatedRange()`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/xychart/#getUpdatedRange_method) method is now public so you can use it to recalculate absolute axis range into a relative that takes current zoom and inversion into account.
- `Language` now supports `null` in translations which means an empty string.
- Interface `iColorSetStepOptions` was renamed to `IColorSetStepOptions` to maintain consistency.
- Interface `ColorPurpose` was renamed to `IColorPurpose` to maintain consistency.
- `FlowDiagramNode` `value` property renamed to `total`, added `totalIncoming` and `totalOutgoing` properties which hold sum of all incoming/outgoing links.
- Removed aliases `startCategory`, `startValue`, and `startDate` from Axes data items. (use `category`, `value`, and `date` respectively)

### Fixed
- Improved performance of Sankey/Chord Diagrams.
- Elements of `TreeMapChart` were not respecting locale.
- Fixed-height bars were drawn incorrectly.
- Pre-hidden series were not taken into account when calculating min/max of value axes in some cases.
- Setting chart data with less data items then there were before resulted in an error.


## [4.0.0-beta.39] - 2018-07-27

### Added
- `useChartAngles` added to `AxisRendererCircular`. If set to `false` allows to set `startAngle`/`endAngle` to each circular axis individually.

### Fixed
- Fixed problem with custom `Legend` data and initial visibility, you can now use `visible: false` to pre-hide custom legend items.
- Grid Layout fixed, affects Legend.


## [4.0.0-beta.38] - 2018-07-26

### Fixed
- Using `PieSeries` data field `"visible"` was not graying out Legend's marker.


## [4.0.0-beta.37] - 2018-07-26

### Added
- You can now make series initially to be hidden by setting `series.visible = false`.
- `visible` added to `PieSeries.dataFields`. It allows making some of the slices initially hidden.

### Changed
- Sankey/Chord diagrams has now toggling nodes enabled by default. To disable, set `chart.nodes.template.togglable = false`.

### Fixed
- Text formatter now correctly escapes double square/curly brackets, as well as empty formatting blocks `[]`.
- Setting `series.visible = false` or `series.hide()` wasn't toggling off related item in Legend.
- Setting `isActive` did not affect `Container`'s background (assuming it had `"active"` state).


## [4.0.0-beta.36] - 2018-07-25

### Added
- `elements` property in `Popup`. Returns an object consisting of references to various elements of the Popup, like content block, close button, etc.

### Changed
- `am4core.getSystem()` has been changed to `am4core.system`

### Fixed
- Fixed double "amcharts" in Popup's class names.
- Fixed dragging on of absolute-positioned Popups.
- Escaping square brackets in text (by repeating them twice) was not working.
- Fixed a lot of disposer leaks.
- Fixed an issue that caused runtime errors with Rollup.


## [4.0.0-beta.35] - 2018-07-23

### Added
- New adapter on `Component` (and everything that inherits it including charts and series): `"data"`.
- New adapter on `Popup`: `"closable"`.

### Changed
- `showModal()` and `hideModal()` methods were renamed to `openModal()` and `closeModal()` respectively.
- `show()` and `hide()` methods on `Popup`/`Modal` were renamed to `open()` and `close()` respectively.

### Fixed
- More performance-related improvements, especially with `CategoryAxis`.
- Changing `interactionsEnabled` from `false` to `true` was not working properly in IE.
- Setting `axisRenderer.inside = true` after chart was already built didn't work.
- `zoomlevelchanged` event of `MapChart` was being fired even if zoom level did not change.
- Setting `MapChart.deltaLongitude` was ignored if it was set before projection was set.
- Map tooltip bounds were not being updated when map container's size changed.


## [4.0.0-beta.34] - 2018-07-22

### Fixed
- Dramatic performance improvements!


## [4.0.0-beta.33] - 2018-07-19

### Added
- `calculatePercent` flag added to `Series`. Default value is `false`, except for `PieSeries`. Series will not calculate percent values of each data item if this is not explicitly set to `true`. Since it wasn't been used anywhere but Pie chart, this should improve performance of initial data parsing.

### Fixed
- Performance improvements. Especially when zooming/scrolling chart with a lot of data.
- `lineSeries` was not paying attention to `propertyField` values set in data.
- Radar and Gauge charts were not centered properly when resizing window.
- Container's background properties were not copied when cloning container.


## [4.0.0-beta.32] - 2018-07-17

### Important (potentially breaking changes)
- To maintain event-naming consistency, events `"insert"` and `"remove"` were renamed to `"inserted"` and `"removed"` respectively in `List` and its inheriting classes. [#132]
- To maintain event-naming consistency, events `"clear"` and `"remove"` were renamed to `"cleared"` and `"removed"` respectively in `Dictionary` and its inheriting classes.

### Fixed
- Significant performance improvements were made.
- JSON config: Filters could not be used.
- Some properties were not being copied when cloning objects, e.g. `segments` in `LineSeries`. (`interactionsEnabled` and some others)
- Circular axis was not properly drawing grid lines if `radius` was < `percent(100)`.
- `Button` label was "stealing" interactions from the button itself.
- `Tooltip` was sometimes drawn without pointer if "animated" theme was not enabled.
- Fixed label alignment of Y axis.

### Changed
- Improved `contentAlign` (when content size is bigger than actual size of a container).

### Added
- Two new adapters added to `Label`: `"textOutput"` and `"htmlOutput"`. Both are applied **after** label contents (text or HTML respectively) are populated with data.
- Added `"custom"` option to export menu types, which now allows creating clickable custom items in the `ExportMenu`.
- `Legend` now accepts "raw" data, enabling creating custom items: `legend.data = [{name:"name 1", fill:"#ff0000"}, {name:"name 2", fill:"#00ff00"}]`. Important: a legend with custom items must be added to some chart container manually (e.g. `chart.chartContainer`). Assigning it to `chart.legend` will overwrite its data.

## [4.0.0-beta.31] - 2018-07-06

### Important
- Layouting mechanism was revamped to make it more consistent and intuitive. If you see some layout issues with your chart, please let us know!

### Added
- New chart type: [`ChordDiagram`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/chord-diagram/).

### Changed
- The `Adapter` `keys` property is now a 0-argument function and not a property.
- `Adapter` callback now has third parameter `key`, which is a string indentifier of the adapter being applied.
- `ChordDiagram`, same as `SankeyDiagram` now extend `FlowDiagram` class. `FlowDiagram` can not be instantiated alone, it's a base class for those two.
- `minWidth`/`minHeight` is now set to some small amount on a `PieChart` so that it remains visible even, if the oversized legend does not fit into container.
- `heatRules` no longer override properties if they are set using `propertyFields`.

### Fixed
- Printing in Firefox was broken after latest updates in export/print.
- Re-enabled data export on legacy IEs.
- If a legend was initially disabled, it did not show up after enabling it later.
- Series tooltip was not disposed when series was disposed. This could result in tooltips hanging and not hidin in such charts as `TreeMap` after data was changed.
- `Tooltip` was sometimes flickeing at 0,0 position when first hovered on columns of a series.
- When all values were 0, `XYChart` was not displayed properly.
- When all values were equal and less than 0, `XYChart` was not displayed properly.
- Zero-value slices were shown as black rectangles in the pie chart legend.
- Labels were not showing tooltips.
- `LineSeries` was not displayed properly if colors were set in data. (using `propertyFields`)
- Tooltips were shown with white background when first hovered over slices/columns/etc.
- Setting `interactionsEnabled = true` did not if it was set to `false` previously.
- `axisFill` was not showing `innerRadius` correctly if it was set as `Percent`.
- Data update on `SankyDiagram` was resulting in error.

## [4.0.0-beta.30] - 2018-06-22

### Fixed
- JSON config: `heatRules` can now refer to bullets in `tartget` using syntax `"bullets.0.property"`, e.g. `"bullets.0.circle"`. (meaning use "circle" property of the first bullet as heat rule target)
- Export: fixed SVG export on Firefox.
- Export: fixed SVG/CSV/JSON export for Edge/IE.
- Export: fixed sheet name limitations for Excel export.
- Export: print option was printing the whole page instead of just chart on IEs.
- Export: fixed bitmap image export on IEs.
- [Issue 65.](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts4/issues/65)

### Changed
- `class` attribute is no longer applied to elements by default. To enable it use new setting `am4core.options.autoSetClassName`.
- `class` attributes now will contain the whole inheritance chain, e.g. `"amcharts-Sprite amcharts-Container amcharts-Button"`. Class names are no longer lowercased.
- The `svgContainer` property is now an `SVGContainer`, not an `HTMLElement`.

### Added
- New global option `am4core.options.autoSetClassName` (default `false`). If set to `true` will set `class` attribute of all elements that reflect class element was created in, including inheritance, e.g. `"amcharts-Sprite amcharts-Container amcharts-Button"`.

### Removed
- Element-level `classNamePrefix` is no longer available. Use global `am4core.options.autoSetClassName` instead.

## [4.0.0-beta.29] - 2018-06-16

### Fixed
- Wrong `Cursor` behavior in Edge browser on hybrid touch screens.
- Malfunctioning colors in IE9.
- Console errors, triggered by mouse hover in IE9.
- A bunch of errors and bugs on Popup/Modal in IE9.
- Enabling `ExportMenu` on IEs was breaking the chart.
- `"dragstop"` event was not being triggered on touch and hybrid devices.

### Changed
- Dramatically improved performance of dragging of Popup.
- The `dataItem` of the tooltip is now set sooner, which enables it to be used in its various adapters.

### Added
- `Sprite` now has [`hoverOptions`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/sprite/#hoverOptions_property) which can be used to set up how touch "hovering" works.

## [4.0.0-beta.28] - 2018-06-05

### Fixed
- Using chart `Cursor` now prevents default browser gestures on touch and hybrid displays.
- Disabling elements (e.g. Legend or Axis labels) will now make other elements take up vacant space automatically.
- Tooltips on `XYSeries` data items with zero value were not being shown.
- Sometimes `XYSeries` tooltips were messed up and shown in incorrect position.
- Updating chart data with stacked series could result incorrect min/max values on `ValueAxis`.
- `Treemap` was not showing all the required levels on zoom-out unless animated theme was being used.
- Sometimes unpredictable behavior of labels on a logarithmic value axis was fixed.
- `DateAxis` with `skipEmptyPeriods = true` was showing axis tooltip at incorrect positions in some cases.

### Changed
- `Sprite.mouseEnabled` was renamed to `interactionsEnabled`.
- An option `"mouse"` for `tooltipPosition` was renamed to `"pointer"`.

## [4.0.0-beta.27] - 2018-06-01

### Fixed
- Issue with `Label` text truncation.
- Huge performance improvements, especially on initial chart load.
- `Animation.resume()` was not working.

### Changed
- Default `tooltipLocation` on `SankeyLink` is now `0.5`.
- Default value of `series.hiddenState.opacity` is now `0` (was `1`). Animated theme sets it to `1`, because it animates stuff by interpolation, rather than fade.

### Added
- `pt_BR` and `en_CA` locales.
- `fullWords` property on `Label`. Works only when `truncate = true`. Setting to `false` will force non-fitting label to be truncated in the middle of the word.

## [4.0.0-beta.26] - 2018-05-30

### Fixed
- Error with `EventDispatcher is disposed`.
- Having "stray" axis objects (not attached to any chart) was resulting in critical error.
- Zooming was broken on `RadarCursor` since last update.
- `PieSeries.legendSettings` were being ingored.
- `Cursor` was incorrectly doing `panY` (inverted).
- Date axis tooltip was not rounding dates to `baseDuration`.
- Date axis was not working properly with `min`/`max` values set.

### Changed
- Redone chart print functionality. Now printing is done via `<iframe>` by default. An alternative CSS option is also available.
- If series' bullets have hover state set, it will be applied whenever chart cursor is over position, even if not directly hovering over bullet.
- `XYSeries` used hidden/default state `transitionDuration` for interpolating values when showing/hiding series. Now they use `series.interpolationDuration`.
- ZoomOut button was under the cursor lines making it impossible to click.
- `easing` renamed to `transitionEasing` in SpriteState, for consistency.
- When setting `width`/`height` for an element in pixels, `minWidth` and `maxWidth` is also set to the same values.
- If `interpolationDuration` is 0 and `hiddenState.transitionDuration > 0`, the series will transit to hidden state first and then instantly interpolate values to 0.

### Added
- Finished cursor updates to support cursor syncing.

## [4.0.0-beta.25] - 2018-05-25

### Fixed
- Using `tooltipHTML` was very buggy.
- Text formatting with two adjacent formatting blocks (`[...][...]`) was broken.
- `DateFormatter` was ignoring `utc` setting when formatting dates.
- Popup no longer obstructs the chart around it.
- Popup/Modal and Export Menu now temporarily disable all interactivity behind it.

### Added
- `DataSource` now has property [`requestOptions`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/datasource/#requestOptions_property) which you can use to add custom request headers to HTTP(S) requests.
- `Popup.title` property.
- `Popup.draggable` property (boolean). Default `true`. Makes popups draggable.
- `ru_RU` (Russian) and `nl_NL` (Dutch) translations.
- `Dictionary`, `DictionaryTemplate`, `List`, `ListTemplate`, `OrderedList`, `OrderedListTemplate`, `SortedList`, and `SortedListTemplate` have these new methods:
- `each` (which calls a function for each element in the data structure)
- `Symbol.iterator` (which is used for the ES6 iterator protocol)
- New `Cursor` event: `"behaviorcanceled"`. (called when zoom/pan/select operation is abandoned)
- New `Cursor` methods: [`triggerMove()`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/cursor/#triggerMove_method), [`triggerDown()`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/cursor/#triggerDown_method), and [`triggerUp()`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/cursor/#triggerUp_method) for improving cursor syncing and manual placement.
- Support for `Series.heatRules` in JSON chart config.
- JSON config now supports arrays in `events` and `adapter`.

### Changed
- HTML labels now take `fill` (color) parameter into account by translating it into `color` CSS property of the style.
- Now when data loader gracefully handles CORS and other critical load errors.
- `Chart.openPopup()` now does not ignore second parameter. (title)
- Changed default International English time with seconds format to `"HH:mm:ss"`.
- Date format on `DateAxis` tooltip will now use axis' `minPeriod` rather than current label period.
- `EventDispatacher.has()` function's second parameter (callback) is now optional. If it's not specified it will check whether **any** event handlers are present for this particular event type.

## [4.0.0-beta.24] - 2018-05-16
### Fixed
- Mouse/touch-related functionality was preventing text selection on the whole document.

### Added
- Added examples in JSON format. (available in JS-oriented packages and GitHub only)
- New events on `ExportMenu`: `"branchselected"`, `"branunselected"`, `"closed"`.
- Added [`Sprite.hoverOnFocus`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/sprite/#hoverOnFocus_property) boolean setting. If set to `true` element will also trigger hover events on it when it gains focus, e.g. display tooltip. (accessibility feature)

## [4.0.0-beta.23] - 2018-05-13
### Fixed
- Various internal things were not properly disposed.

## [4.0.0-beta.22] - 2018-05-13
### Fixed
- Heights of vertical `HeatLegend`'s gradient band and value axis (labels) were different.
- `HeatLegend` without its `series` set was resulting in critical error.
- `HeatLegend` did not respect `dataField` setting in `Series.heatRules`.

### Removed
- `newStack` from Series which was redundant.

## [4.0.0-beta.21] - 2018-05-10
### Added
- New element class [`Popup`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/popup/).
- New way to display pop-ups on charts via [`Sprite.popups`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/sprite/#popups_property) and [`Sprite.openPopup`](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/reference/sprite/#openPopup_method).
- New example "adding-live-data".
