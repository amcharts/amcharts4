/**
 * A plugin which automatically groups [[PercenSeries]] slices that are smaller
 * than certain percent into one "Other" slice.
 *
 * By pushing an instance of [[Annnotation]] into `plugin` list of
 * any [[Chart]], it automatically applies the functionality.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```TypeScript
 * let overlap = chart.plugins.push(new am4plugins_overlapBuster.OverlapBuster());
 * overlap.targets.push(bullet);
 * ```
 * ```JavaScript
 * let overlap = chart.plugins.push(new am4plugins_overlapBuster.OverlapBuster());
 * overlap.targets.push(bullet);
 * ```
 * ```JSON
 * // this plugin does not support JSON config
 * ```
 *
 * @since 4.6.2
 * @see {@link https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/tutorials/plugin-overlap-buster/} for more information and usage instructions
