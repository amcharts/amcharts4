adapter\r\n * interface defined.\r\n *\r\n * Adapters can be used to allow external code to apply transformations to any\r\n * value at any time.\r\n *\r\n * For example we have a Weather class which has a method `now()` which returns\r\n * current temperature.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * function now() {\r\n *   // ... calculate temperature\r\n *   let temp = \"Temperature now is \" + degrees + \"F\";\r\n *   return temp;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Now, supposed we want to let other classes to modify the output of the\r\n * `now()`? We just apply an adapter to the `temp` before it is returned:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * temp = this.adapters.apply(\"now\", {\r\n *   temp: temp,\r\n *   degrees: degrees\r\n * }).temp;\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Some other class might tap onto it by defining an Adapter that calculates\r\n * the temperature in Celsius:\r\n *\r\n * weather.adapters.add(\"now\", (arg) => {\r\n *   arg.temp += \"(\" + farenheitToCelsius(arg.degrees) + \"C)\";\r\n *   return arh;\r\n * });\r\n *\r\n * Furthermore some time-related class could add time:\r\n *\r\n * weather.adapters.add(\"now\", (arg) => {\r\n *   arg.temp += \"; the time now is \" + (new Date().toLocaleString());\r\n *   return arh;\r\n * });\r\n *\r\n * So without adapters we would get output like this:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * Temperature now is 90F\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With adapters applied we now have:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * Temperature now is 90F (32C); the time now is 12/11/2012, 7:00:00 PM\r\n * ```\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * ============================================================================\r\n * IMPORTS\r\n * ============================================================================\r\n * @hidden\r\n */\r\nimport { BaseObject } from \"../Base\";\r\nimport { SortedList, ISortedListEvents } from \"./SortedList\";\r\nimport { EventDispatcher, AMEvent } from \"./EventDispatcher\";\r\nimport * as $number from \"./Number\";\r\nimport * as $order from \"./Order\";\r\nimport * as $iter from \"../utils/Iterator\";\r\nimport * as $array from \"../utils/Array\";\r\nimport * as $type from \"../utils/Type\";\r\n\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * ============================================================================\r\n * REQUISITES\r\n * ============================================================================\r\n * @hidden\r\n */\r\n/**\r\n * Adapter interface.\r\n */\r\ninterface IAdapterCallback<Target, T> {\r\n\tid: number;\r\n\tkey: keyof T;\r\n\tcallback: (value: T[keyof T], target: Target) => T[keyof T];\r\n\tscope: any;\r\n\tpriority: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Defines an interface for a global adapter.\r\n */\r\ninterface IGlobalAdapterCallback {\r\n\tid: number;\r\n\tkey: string;\r\n\tcallback: <T, Target, Key extends keyof T, C>(this: C, value: T[Key], target: Target) => T[Key];\r\n\tscope: any;\r\n\tpriority: number;\r\n\ttype: { new(): any };\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * ============================================================================\r\n * GLOBAL ADAPTER\r\n * ============================================================================\r\n * @hidden\r\n */\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * A global adapter is an adpater that is attached to a class type rather than\r\n * specific object instance.\r\n *\r\n * @ignore Exclude from docs\r\n */\r\nexport class GlobalAdapter {\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Callback id iterator.\r\n\t * \r\n\t * @type {number}\r\n\t */\r\n\tprivate _callbackId: number = 0;\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * A list of if callbacks (adapters).\r\n\t * \r\n\t */\r\n\tprivate _callbacks = new SortedList<IGlobalAdapterCallback>((left, right) => {\r\n\t\treturn $order.or($number.order(left.priority, right.priority),\r\n\t\t\t$number.order(left.id, right.id));\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tpublic addAll<T, Target, Key extends keyof T>(\r\n\t\ttype: { new(): Target },\r\n\t\tkey: Key,\r\n\t\tcallback: (value: T[Key], target: Target) => T[Key],\r\n\t\tpriority?: number\r\n\t): void;\r\n\r\n\tpublic addAll<T, Target, Key extends keyof T, C>(\r\n\t\ttype: { new(): Target },\r\n\t\tkey: Key,\r\n\t\tcallback: (this: C, value: T[Key], target: Target) => T[Key],\r\n\t\tpriority?: number,\r\n\t\tscope?: C\r\n\t): void;\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Adds a global callback which is not specific to any particular object.\r\n\t * Whenever an adapter in any object of the specific class type is invoked\r\n\t * global adapters will kick in.\r\n\t * \r\n\t * @param {any}         type      Class type\r\n\t * @param {any}         key       Adapter key\r\n\t * @param {any}         callback  Callback function\r\n\t * @param {number = 0}  priority  Priority (higher priority meaning adapter will be applied later)\r\n\t * @param {any}         scope     Callback function scaope\r\n\t */\r\n\tpublic addAll(type: any, key: any, callback: any, priority: number = 0, scope?: any): void {\r\n\t\tthis._callbacks.insert({\r\n\t\t\tid: ++this._callbackId,\r\n\t\t\tkey: key,\r\n\t\t\tcallback: callback,\r\n\t\t\tpriority: priority,\r\n\t\t\tscope: scope,\r\n\t\t\ttype: type\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Returns if there are adapters for specific type available.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param  {Target}   type  Adapter type\r\n\t * @param  {Key}      key   Adapter key\r\n\t * @return {boolean}\r\n\t */\r\n\tpublic isEnabled<T, Target, Key extends keyof T>(type: Target, key: Key): boolean {\r\n\t\t// TODO check the type and key\r\n\t\treturn this._callbacks.length > 0;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Applies global adapters for the object of the specific type.\r\n\t * \r\n\t * @param {any}  type   Class type\r\n\t * @param {any}  key    Adapter key\r\n\t * @param {any}  value  Value\r\n\t */\r\n\tpublic applyAll<T, Target, Key extends keyof T = keyof T>(type: Target, key: Key, value: T[Key]): T[Key] {\r\n\t\t// This is needed to improve the performance and reduce garbage collection\r\n\t\tconst callbacks = this._callbacks.values;\r\n\t\tconst length = callbacks.length;\r\n\r\n\t\t// Cycle through all callbacks and find the ones we need to use\r\n\t\tfor (let i = 0;
